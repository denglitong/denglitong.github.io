Her high-heeled shoes **sounding like** litter **firecrackers** going off on the wooden floor.

    听起来像；鞭炮；

You both have been accepted in new **temporay care homes** starting this afternoon.

    临时寄宿家庭

Jerry looked like he'd just found out they were going to **dip** him in **a pot of boiling milk**.

    浸；一壶滚烫的牛奶；

There's a **depression** going on all over this country.

    萧条

People can't find jobs and these are very, very **difficult times for** everybody. We've been lucky enough to find two wonderful families who've **opened their doors for** you.

In the meantime go to the sleep room and **strip your beds** and gather all of your things.

    收拾你的床

I felt like I was **walking in my sleep**.

    在睡梦中行走

This was the third **foster home** I was going to and I'm used to packing up and leaving, but it still surprises me that there are always a few seconds, right after they tell you you've got to go, when my **nose gets all runny** and my **throat gets all choky** and my **eyes get all sting-y**.

    foster home 寄养家庭
    nose gets all runny 鼻子流鼻涕
    throat gets all choky 喉咙变得哽咽
    eyes get all sting-y 眼睛变得刺痛

But the **tears coming out** doesn't happen to my anymore, I don't know when it first happened, but it seems like my eyes don't cry no more.

    tears coming out 流眼泪

He was **losing the fight** not to cry. Tears were **popping out of** his eyes and **slipping down** his **cheeks**.

    lose the fight 输掉战斗
    pop out of 涌出、弹出
    slip down 滑落
    cheeks 脸颊

The worst thing that's going to happen to you is that they're going to make you **play house** a lot.

    过家家

I tickled Jerry under his chin.

    在下巴挠痒痒

Being six is a real rough age to be at.

    六岁是一个真正艰难的年龄

Cause it's around six that grown floks stop giving you **little swats and taps **and jump clean up to giving you slugs that'll knock you right down and have you seeing stars in the middle of the day.

    little swats and taps 小打小闹
    give slugs 猛击
    see stars in the middle of the day 眼冒金星

The first foster home I was in **taught me that real quick**.

    很快就教会了我现实

It's around then that **your teeth start coming a-loose in your mouth**.

    开始掉牙

Your tongue is pushing and rubbing up againse one of your **front teeth**.

    你的舌头在推动和摩擦你的门牙

Perfectly good parts of your body commence to loosening up and falling off of you.

    commence to 开始...
    loosen up 松动
    fall off of 从...掉落

As stupid as a **lamppost**.

    傻的像个路灯柱一样

I folded the blanket and sheet and set  them back on the mattress. Most of the kids in the Home keep their things in a paper or cloth sack, but not to me. I have my own suitcase.

    blanket 毯子
    mattress 床垫
    close sack 衣架
    suitcase 手提箱

It was like something was telling me there was a message for me on this flyer but I didn't havee the decoder rng to read what it was.

I went over to the big chest of drawers and took my other set of clothes out and put them in the suitcase too.
