## Acknowledgment

- [Return to parent index](./index.md)

I am so fortunate to have been welcomed into the world of literature for young people, I want to **give heartfelt thanks to** everyone at Delacorte Press for all they have done to make this experience so memorable.

    由衷的感谢

I also wish to thank a group of authors who have generously given encouragment at every opportunity; and special thanks to two writers **who have no idea how important their shoulders and words have been to me**.

**My rock**, my wife. 

    我的妻子，我坚强的后盾
